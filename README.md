## ⚠️ A Note About the Source Code, Project
> **"It works on my machine, Sketchware!"** 🗿
> **" I Dont Tested Android Studio Version, But This app Fully Created In Sketchware PRO.🪄 Used Sketchware Feature To Export Android Studio Source. And i dont know its working in Android Studio Or Not 😭"**

Look, I'm gonna be honest with you. The app works perfectly, the UI is fire, but the source code under the hood is... let's call it **"Creative Chaos"**. Android Studio And Swb File is too Messy and incomprehensible .
I used some *unique* string arrangements and *abstract* coding styles. If you look at the code and get a headache, that's a feature, not a bug. 😂

**Pull Requests?** Sure, if you are brave enough to untangle the spaghetti! 🍝

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java / Android SDK
* **Design:** Material Design 3 Components
